# Squash Hawkeye üéæ

**AI-Powered Line-Calling System for Squash**

> **Academic Research Project** | University of East Anglia | Ubiquitous Computing Module

## üöÄ Project Impact
**Problem**: Amateur squash lacks affordable line-calling technology, while professional systems cost $60,000-$100,000 per court, leading to disputed calls that can dramatically shift match momentum.
**Solution**: Synchronized audio-visual detection system using accessible hardware (smartphone + laptop) that achieves **82% accuracy** in challenging edge cases for service line violations.
